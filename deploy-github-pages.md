### 2. Go to Settings
- Click the "Settings" tab at the top
- Scroll down in the left sidebar
- Click "Pages"

### 3. Configure Source
- Under "Source", click the dropdown
- Select "Deploy from a branch"
- Under "Branch", select "main"
- Under "Folder", select "/ (root)"
- Click "Save"

### 4. Wait for Deployment
- You'll see "Your site is being built"
- Wait 5-10 minutes
- Look for green checkmark

### 5. Your Site URL

## Alternative: Use Netlify (Already Working!)
Your portfolio is already live at: https://ronith-dataanalyst-portfolio.netlify.app

## Troubleshooting
If GitHub Pages doesn't work:
1. Check the Actions tab for errors
2. Make sure all files are in the root directory
3. Wait longer for first deployment
4. Use Netlify as backup (already working)
